1. Introduction
===============

This toolkit is intended to provide software infrastructure for rapidly
constructing experiments involving the evolutionary programming technique
introduced by Candida Ferreira and recently published in an issue
of the Complex Systems journal.  Java was chosen for a few reasons:

- portability of GUI implementations and compiled code
- clean OO language with nice dynamic runtime characteristics (IE, it's not
  a train wreck like C++)
- migrating to a multi-threaded or distributed implementation is almost
  trivial with Java
- for prototyping of experiments, speed and ease of use is most important,
  not optimal performance.  Once an experimenter moves on to the phase where
  production-style speeds are required, the application can and should be
  ported to a more appropriate language.

2. CGep
=======

The cgep directory contains a C version of a GEP implementation of the 
regression problem.  It isn't as general as the Java code, since this is
a bit harder in C, but a good deal of the infrastructure for structs
representing populations and genomes is there.
